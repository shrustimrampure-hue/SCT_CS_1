# 👑 Caesar Cipher Program

A classic substitution cipher implemented in Python for basic text encryption and decryption.

---

## 🔑 Features
- **Dual Mode**: Supports both encryption (`e`) and decryption (`d`).
- **Alphabet Wraparound**: Correctly handles letter shifts that go past `z` or before `a`.
- **Non-Alphabetic Preservation**: Keeps spaces, punctuation, and numbers unchanged.
