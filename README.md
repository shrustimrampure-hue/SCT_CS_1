👑 # Caesar Cipher Program
A classic and foundational substitution cipher implemented for educational purposes.

💻 Task 1: Caesar Cipher Program Features
This program enables the encoding and decoding of messages using the Caesar Cipher, which shifts each letter of the message by a fixed number of positions (the key) up or down the alphabet.

🔑 Features
Dual Mode Functionality: Supports both Encryption (e) and Decryption (d) using the same core logic.

Reversible Logic: Decryption is handled efficiently by applying a negative key shift, effectively reversing the encryption process. The relationship is:
